# Boulevard Of Broken Links
## What?

Fetch a URL, parse all hyperlinks from the returned HTML and check each hyperlinks status. Collect all broken links (http status >= 400) and send an email to owner about it.

## Why the name?

```
  I walk a lonley URL
  The only one that I have ever known
  Don't know where it goes
  But it's only me and I walk alone
